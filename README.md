# Demon Engine
---

This is a try to make an engine to create SMT-inspired games.

## Wanted basic features:

- CRUD elements
- CRUD resistances
- CRUD ailments
- CRUD stats (usef for damage / resistance formulas)
- CRUD races (used for fusing)
- CRUD skills (with elemental affinities, damage formulas and effect)
- CRUD demons with everything that was mentioned above + some other stuff (their lore, a picture, and that kind of stuff)

## Wanted gameplay features:

- Dungeon creator with an automatic minimap
- Dialog textboxes and triggers
- A somewhat nice UI.
